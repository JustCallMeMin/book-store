## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## API Testing with Postman

A Postman collection has been provided to help you test the API endpoints. To use it:

1. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) if you haven't already
2. Import the collection from `postman/book-store.postman_collection.json`
3. Import the environment from `postman/book-store.postman_environment.json`
4. Select the "Book Store Local" environment from the dropdown in the top right
5. Use the collection to test the various API endpoints

The collection includes:
- Authentication endpoints (register, login, logout)
- Gutendex API endpoints (search books, get book details, import books)
- Google Books API endpoints (search books, get book details, import books)

### Authentication Flow

1. Use the Register request to create a new account
2. Use the Login request to obtain an access token
3. The token will be automatically stored in the environment variable `{{authToken}}`
4. All subsequent requests will use this token for authorization

### Automated Testing

For automated API testing, an additional collection is provided:

1. Import the automation collection from `postman/automate-flow.postman_collection.json`
2. Open Postman's Collection Runner (Runner button in the bottom bar)
3. Select the "Book Store API - Automation Flow" collection
4. Click "Run" to execute the entire testing workflow automatically

The automated workflow will:
- Register a new random test user
- Authenticate and store the token
- Search and import books from both Gutendex and Google Books APIs
- Verify the imported books
- Clean up test data and log out

See `postman/README.md` for more detailed information about the test scripts.
